SQL-Challenge

The first task as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard is to analyze the employee data of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

There are three major components of this project data modeling, data engineering and data analysis.

Data Modeling

Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables using QuickDBD.

Data Engineering

Used the information in the given csv files to create a table schema for each of the CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table in PostgreSQL.

Data Analysis

The queries for the following  questions are created .

1.	List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2.	List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3.	List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4.	List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5.	List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6.	List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7.	List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
